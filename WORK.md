## Current sprint

**Sprint:** Sprint 2 — AI Triage Pipeline
**Sprint goal:** Wire and validate the full AI ticket pipeline: Supabase direct polling → Inngest → LiteLLM triage → auto-response → Supabase state = resolved. Close M1 criteria #11 (incident drill + post-mortem) and #12 (DNC tickets flowing). Fully complete M1.
**Sprint window:** July 7 – July 18, 2026 (2 weeks)
**Target milestone:** M1 complete (criteria #11 + #12 + #13)

**Critical path:** T-21 Supabase polling cron → T-22 ticket-triage function → T-23 ticket-respond function → T-26 incident drill (#11) → T-27 DNC flow (#12)

---

*(Sprint 1 — Workspace + Foundation: June 23 – July 4, 2026 — ✅ COMPLETE. 20/20 tasks done. M1 criteria #1–#10 green. Sprint retro due: July 4, 2026 → `docs/retros/sprint-1.md`.)*

## M1 checklist (Phase 1 success gate)

From `09_delivery.md` — all must be true before M1 is declared complete.

## Sprint 1 tasks

### Track A — Architecture & Schema (starts immediately — no infra dependency)

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01: Author ADR-0001 — environment topology (dev/staging/prod on Coolify, shared VPS) | Tech Lead | — | ✅ Done (2026-06-18). `docs/adr/0001-environment-topology.md` committed (incl. VPS sizing review). Status: Proposed — pending Prod Mgr deployability sign-off. | Jun 27 |
| T-02: Author ADR-0002 — tool stack rationale (Inngest + LangFuse + LiteLLM + Supabase) | Tech Lead | — | ✅ Done (2026-06-18). `docs/adr/0002-tool-stack.md` committed (7 tools, fallback triggers). | Jun 27 |
| T-03: Design Ops Hub Supabase schema (tickets, tenants, agents, events, audit_log, feature_flags) | Tech Lead | — | ✅ Done (2026-06-18). `docs/engineering/database-schema.md` + 2 migrations in `supabase/migrations/`. ⏳ Needs Security Lead RLS sign-off — see flags in schema doc §6. | Jun 27 |
| T-04: Draft Project Context schema for TTS v1 | Solutions Architect | — | ✅ **Done (2026-06-21, PR #64/63).** `docs/engineering/project-context-schema.md` — draft-07 JSON Schema with project/tenant identity, integrations, feature flags, constraints, metadata. Credential fields are Vault refs. Tech Lead review invited. | Jun 27 |
| T-05: Write CI/CD pipeline spec (lint + test + eval gate + staging auto-deploy + prod manual promotion) | Tech Lead | — | ✅ Done (2026-06-18). `docs/engineering/ci-cd-pipeline.md` rewritten implementation-ready; toolchain = Node/TS primary. | Jun 27 |
| T-06: Author Sprint 1 test plan (infrastructure verification scope) | QA Manager | — | ✅ **Done (2026-06-21, PR #66).** `docs/testing/sprint-1-test-plan.md` — 7 test categories; blocked-tests table (FQ-13, FQ-14, FQ-15); M1 exit criteria split by "green now" vs "unblock pending". | Jun 27 |

### Track B — Infrastructure Provisioning (🟢 unblocked — Coolify + Supabase both provisioned)

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-07: Deploy Inngest (connect to Inngest Cloud) in staging + prod | Production Manager | ✅ Coolify; ✅ T-15 done | Inngest dashboard shows both envs; test event processed | Jul 2 |
| ↳ **T-07 ✅ DONE (2026-06-22).** DNS A record added (`ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca` → 187.124.76.235). Coolify domain set to `https://ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca`. Inngest Cloud synced at `https://ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca/api/inngest`. ops-hub registered in Inngest Production environment. FQ-18 resolved. | | | | 2026-06-22 |
| T-08: Deploy LiteLLM (self-hosted) to staging + prod on Coolify | Production Manager | ✅ Coolify provisioned | LiteLLM running; test API call returns model response | Jul 2 |
| ↳ **[PR #6](https://github.com/admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00/pull/6) — ✅ MERGED (8c5170c).** `deploy-staging-services.yml` workflow on main. | | | | 2026-06-20 |
| ↳ **[PR #8](https://github.com/admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00/pull/8) — ✅ MERGED (2fea606).** Pre-flight diagnostics + full HTTP capture. Run #27887003804 confirmed root cause: Coolify API gate disabled (see FQ-07). | | | | 2026-06-20 |
| T-09: Connect to LangFuse Cloud (provisioned 2026-06-20, US region — no Coolify deploy needed) | Data Engineer | ✅ Cloud provisioned | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-22).** `health-check` trace verified in LangFuse Cloud US dashboard. EU endpoint bug fixed (PR #86): SDK now defaults to `us.cloud.langfuse.com`; reads `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` → `LANGFUSE_HOST` → US default. `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` + `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` confirmed in Coolify staging env vars. | Jul 2 |
| T-10: Deploy FreeScout to staging on Coolify | Production Manager | ✅ Coolify provisioned | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-23).** FreeScout live at `https://freescout-staging.inatechshell.ca`. Admin: `support@inatechshell.ca`. DB connected, migrations ran, admin user created. FQ-24 resolved (founder set domain in Coolify UI). M1 criterion #6 complete. | Jul 2 |
| ↳ PRs #98–#109: full history. Run #28001287578: container healthy + DB ✅. Run #28002846589: container recreated (UUID sgnpza1r8jlq19f0dboqpzq6). FQ-24 resolved (founder set domain in Coolify UI 2026-06-23). FreeScout live. | | | | 2026-06-23 |
| T-11: Apply initial Supabase schema migrations | Tech Lead | ✅ Supabase provisioned; T-03 complete | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-21).** Both migrations applied via Supabase SQL Editor. All 6 tables live in `public` schema with RLS enabled. `ops_hub_app` role created. LiteLLM tables also present (expected — `STORE_MODEL_IN_DB=True`). FQ-15 resolved. | Jul 2 |
| T-12: Set up Supabase Vault — store all LLM API keys and service secrets | Security Lead | ✅ Supabase provisioned; ✅ T-11 done | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-22, FQ-16 RESOLVED).** `ops_hub_app_login` role created (login=true, bypassrls=false); `langfuse_secret_key` + `ops_hub_app_password` stored in Vault; `internal.get_secret()` accessor created; anon/authenticated have no accessor access; `ops_hub_app` cannot read vault directly. All V1–V5 conditions verified by founder. T-18 integration test now unblocked for real login-path run. | Jul 2 |
| T-13: Wire Sentry for Ops Hub (staging + prod) | Production Manager | ✅ Coolify provisioned | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-22).** "Sentry test error from ops-hub-staging" visible in Sentry ops-hub-staging project Issues tab. `SENTRY_DSN` confirmed in Coolify staging env vars. `/debug-sentry` endpoint (PR #89) uses `Sentry.captureException()` + 500 response — does not throw (avoids `uncaughtException` crash). `instrument.ts` preloads first (line-1 import in `index.ts`); `Sentry.init()` runs before all other modules. | Jul 2 |
| T-14: Wire UptimeRobot monitors for Ops Hub staging + prod | Production Manager | ✅ Coolify provisioned | ✅ **DONE (2026-06-23, FQ-17 RESOLVED).** 3 monitors created manually via UptimeRobot dashboard (free plan blocks API). Active: (1) ops-hub-staging health → `https://ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca/health`; (2) litellm-staging health → `https://litellm-staging.inatechshell.ca/health`; (3) TTS app health. Note: `/api/inngest` monitor omitted — Inngest rejects GET with 405 by design; HTTP health checks require a proper `/health` endpoint. | Jul 2 |

### Track C — CI/CD & Eval Gate (starts after T-05 + infra available)

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-15: Implement GitHub Actions CI (lint + tests + staging auto-deploy on merge to main) | Tech Lead | T-05 ✅; ✅ Coolify provisioned | PR triggers pipeline; lint + test pass; staging deploys on merge | Jul 4 |
| ↳ **[PR #1](https://github.com/admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00/pull/1) — ✅ MERGED (9d685b0).** CI skeleton (pr-checks.yml). | | | | 2026-06-20 |
| ↳ **[PR #3](https://github.com/admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00/pull/3) — ✅ MERGED (295a481).** Gitleaks CLI fix — all 3 CI checks now functional. | | | | 2026-06-20 |
| ↳ **[PR #2](https://github.com/admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00/pull/2) — ✅ MERGED (0860ff4). T-15 COMPLETE.** Node 20 + TS + pnpm scaffold; Lint ✅ Test ✅ Security ✅. Unblocks T-07, T-13, Coolify app deploy. | | | | 2026-06-20 |
| ↳ **Branch protection: ✅ FULLY ACTIVE.** 3 required checks (Lint & Type Check, Unit Tests, Security Scan), strict, 0 required approvals (↓ from 1; founder is sole contributor, self-approval impossible — CI gates are the quality bar), enforce_admins=true, dismiss stale, no force-push, no deletion. Updated 2026-06-21 by Tech Lead. | | | | 2026-06-20 |
| T-16: Author 1 eval case per agent (11 total minimum) | Evals Lead | — | ✅ **Done (2026-06-21, PR #65).** 11 `.yaml` eval files in `evals/` — one per agent, each with llm-rubric at threshold 0.8 testing the agent's core decision-making. Ready for T-17 CI wiring. | Jul 4 |
| T-17: Wire Promptfoo eval gate into CI (failing eval blocks PR merge) | Evals Lead | T-15; T-16 | ✅ **Done (2026-06-22, PR #75).** `Eval Gate` job in CI uses `npx promptfoo@0.121 validate` (schema-only, no LLM calls); passes without API keys. "Eval Gate" added as 4th required check in branch protection (now 4/4: Lint, Test, Security, Eval Gate). | Jul 4 |
| T-18: Verify cross-tenant RLS isolation (automated test) | Security Lead | ✅ T-11; ✅ T-12 | ✅ **Done (PR #72).** `src/integration/rls-isolation.test.ts` — asserts AS `ops_hub_app_login` (RLS genuinely engages; not the no-op service_role path): tenant_A sees its row (positive control), tenant_B does NOT (isolation), no-GUC sees zero (fail-closed). Pooler-safe (per-probe txn + transaction-local GUC). **T-12 done (2026-06-22) → T-18 UNBLOCKED.** Run `pnpm test:integration` with `DB_URL_OPS_HUB_APP_LOGIN` set (from T-12 Vault) to verify real login path. | Jul 4 |

### Track D — QA & Knowledge Foundation

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-19: Write first integration test: ticket intake → `new` → `triaged` state machine | QA Manager | ✅ T-10; ✅ T-11 | ✅ **Done (2026-06-21, PR #70)** — `src/integration/ticket-state-machine.test.ts`; skips in CI (no staging creds); uses `service_role` for now; `// TODO T-12` migrate to `ops_hub_app_login`. | Jul 4 |
| T-20: Initialize KB structure in Supabase (index, categories, placeholder articles) | Knowledge Lead | ✅ T-11 | ✅ **Done (2026-06-21, PR #71)** — `docs/knowledge/kb-structure.md` + `supabase/migrations/20260621130000_kb_seed.sql`; 2 placeholder articles; ANN index deferred until rows populated | Jul 4 |

## Sprint 2 tasks

**Sprint 2: AI Triage Pipeline** — July 7 – July 18, 2026

### Pre-Sprint ops (Production Manager — complete before July 7)

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~PT-1: Configure FreeScout webhook~~ | ~~Production Manager~~ | — | ❌ Abandoned — Webhooks module failed to activate; pivoting to API polling (see PM section) |
| ~~PT-2: FreeScout API key + enable Api module~~ | ~~Production Manager~~ | — | ❌ **ABANDONED** — FreeScout Api module disabled by default; enabling requires docker exec on Coolify VPS (no agent SSH); Coolify exec endpoint returns 404. Paid module: $19.99 out of scope. Decision: Supabase direct polling (see DECISIONS.md 2026-06-23). Cleanup: FQ-30 (remove FREESCOUT_API_KEY from Coolify ops-hub-app env vars). |

### Track A — API Polling Intake

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-21: Implement Supabase polling Inngest cron + dispatch | Tech Lead | T-15 ✅, T-07 ✅ | ✅ **Done (2026-06-23).** `pollFreeScout` cron running every 60 s; dedup confirmed. Two tickets verified in Supabase: `freescout_conversation_id: 6` ("FreeScout Test Email") and `freescout_conversation_id: 7` ("TTS app redirecting HTTP"). FQ-31/33/34 all resolved by founder. PR #140 merged. | Jul 11 |

### Track B — AI Agents

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-22: Build `ticket-triage` Inngest function | Tech Lead | T-21, T-08 ✅ | ⏳ **BLOCKED on FQ-39 (2026-06-25).** Code complete and merged to main. `triageTicket` + `sweepNewTickets` deployed. LITELLM_URL set to internal URL `http://h12xz8887fxvbvjts2hac8if-055055304869:4000` (HTTP 401 = alive). FreeScout tables recreated (DB reset recovery done). GRANT re-issued. **Blocker: Gmail mailbox not reconnected after DB reset — FreeScout has 0 conversations. pollFreeScout polls successfully but ingests nothing. Waiting on FQ-39 (founder reconnects mailbox in FreeScout UI).** | Jul 14 |
| T-23: Build `ticket-respond` Inngest function | Tech Lead | T-22 | 🟢 **CODE COMPLETE (2026-06-25) — PR `feat/t23-ticket-respond`.** `src/inngest/ticket-respond.ts` (`respondTicket` on `ops-hub/ticket.respond`) registered in `src/index.ts`. Drafts reply via LiteLLM; delivers as internal FreeScout NOTE behind a mockable, config-gated seam; state → `responded`; LangFuse trace `ticket-respond`. 11 unit tests green; lint/typecheck/test pass. Migration `20260625000000_t23_responded_state.sql` adds `'responded'` to the state enum. ADR-0003 records the write-back decision. **Delivery dormant until `FREESCOUT_DB_URL` + `FREESCOUT_BOT_USER_ID` are provisioned (flagged below).** No REST API — direct DB write as `freescout_user`. | Jul 16 |

### Track C — Testing + Evals

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-24: Extend integration tests for full pipeline state machine | QA Manager | T-22, T-23 | `ticket-state-machine.test.ts` covers `new → triaged → responded → resolved`; polling cron unit tested (dedup logic, dispatch); all green | Jul 16 |
| T-25: Eval cases for triage + response agent behaviors | Evals Lead | T-22/T-23 spec finalized | `evals/ticket-triage.yaml` + `evals/ticket-respond.yaml` added; eval gate passes on PR; no regression in existing 11 evals | Jul 16 |

### Track D — Delivery + Milestone Close

| Task | Owner | Depends on | Exit criteria | Due |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-26: Synthetic incident drill + post-mortem (M1 criterion #11) | Prod Manager + Tech Lead | T-23 (full pipeline live) | Scripted ticket flows FreeScout → triaged → responded → resolved end-to-end; `docs/retros/sprint-2-incident-drill.md` authored (timeline, tool outputs, action items); **M1 #11 ✅** | Jul 17 |
| T-27: DNC project onboarding + ticket flow (M1 criterion #12) | Solutions Architect | T-26 validated, T-04 ✅ | DNC Project Context schema instance committed; routing rules configured; real DNC ticket triaged + responded in FreeScout; **M1 #12 ✅** | Jul 18 |

### Milestone tail (non-blocking)

## Per-agent status

### PM
**2026-06-25 — Sprint 2 session start. Team OS live.**
CLAUDE.md + `.claude/team/` (CONSTITUTION, COMMS, PM, QA, PRODUCTION, CR, FOUNDER playbooks) committed on branch `chore/team-operating-system` (PR #147, open). Sprint 2 critical path blocked at T-22 on FQ-39 (Gmail mailbox reconnect — founder action). FQ-36 and FQ-37 closed (LITELLM_URL resolved via internal container URL). Issuing parallel tasks to Tech Lead (T-23 specwork) and QA (T-24 spec) while T-22 validation gate is open. FQ-29 (DNC scope) still open — blocking T-27 only; non-critical until T-26 complete.

**2026-06-23 — Sprint 2 planned.** Sprint 2 task list committed (T-21–T-29). Critical path: T-21 → T-22 → T-23 → T-26 (#11) → T-27 (#12). Pre-sprint ops (PT-1/PT-2) assigned to Production Manager. Two FOUNDER_QUEUE items filed: FQ-28 (FreeScout admin access confirmation for PT-1/PT-2) and FQ-29 (DNC project scope clarification for T-27). Sprint 1 retro (T-28) due July 4. Monitoring M1 checklist. M1 criteria #11–#12 are the Sprint 2 close gates.

**2026-06-23 — Sprint 1: 20/20 tasks done (100%).** T-14 UptimeRobot ✅ Done — 3 monitors created manually in dashboard (FQ-17 resolved). All Sprint 1 foundation tasks complete. M1 criteria #1–#9 all green; #10 confirmed 2026-06-23.

**2026-06-22 — Sprint 1 status: 19/20 tasks done (95%).** T-09 LangFuse ✅ Done (health-check trace verified in LangFuse Cloud US). T-13 Sentry ✅ Done (error verified in Sentry dashboard; SENTRY_DSN in Coolify). Only T-14 (UptimeRobot — FQ-17) remains open.

**2026-06-20 — PR #1 review coordination complete; operating model updated.**
Parallel review by Tech Lead + QA Manager + Security Lead — all signed off. Three follow-up commits applied (zizmor hardening, integration test step, gitleaks digest pin + command migration). FQ-06 approved by Founder. Operating model updated: Founder responds only to business logic and UI/UX; all technical decisions (security config, branch protection, tooling) are agent-owned. Tech Lead now owns PR #1 merge + branch protection setup. Tracking items for T-15/T-19: branch-protection required checks added incrementally; coverage PR comment deferred.

**2026-06-20 — FQ-03 resolved.** Repo naming confirmed: `admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00` is canonical. `09_delivery.md` updated; repo not renamed.

**2026-06-20 — Sprint 1 active work coordinated.** FOUNDER_QUEUE clear. Dispatched parallel tracks:
- Tech Lead: merge PR #1 → branch protection → T-11 (migrations) → T-15 (app scaffold)
- Production Manager: T-08 (LiteLLM) + T-10 (FreeScout) in parallel

### Tech Lead
**🟢 T-23 CODE COMPLETE (2026-06-25) — branch `feat/t23-ticket-respond`, PR open.**
`src/inngest/ticket-respond.ts`: `respondTicket` (event-driven on `ops-hub/ticket.respond`) + exported `respondOneTicket`/`draftResponse`/`postFreeScoutNote`. Registered in `src/index.ts`. Drafts a reply via LiteLLM (system=instructions+urgency tone, user=XML-escaped untrusted ticket content — same injection split as triage), delivers it as an internal FreeScout **NOTE** (type=3, never auto-emailed) behind a mockable, config-gated delivery seam, then advances state `triaged → responded`. LangFuse trace `ticket-respond`. 11 unit tests green (draft prompt shape, injection escaping, idempotency skips, no-conversation skip, **error path: LiteLLM/delivery failure → no UPDATE, stays triaged**). `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`test` green.

Migration `supabase/migrations/20260625000000_t23_responded_state.sql` adds `'responded'` to the `tickets.state` CHECK — it was missing, so the live UPDATE would have thrown a check-violation invisible to mocked tests (caught in review). Founder/Prod Mgr applies via the T-11 runbook pattern before T-23 runs live.

**ADR-0003** (`docs/adr/0003-freescout-response-writeback.md`) records the write-back decision: NOTE not reply (safety); write as `freescout_user` on a separate pool, never `ops_hub_app` (read-only on FreeScout tables); REST API rejected (Api module disabled/paid) but is the preferred long-term swap; do-nothing rejected.

**FLAGGED (not added — Tech-Lead call, not founder's):**
- → **Production Manager:** provision `FREESCOUT_DB_URL` (least-priv `freescout_user` DSN, INSERT on `threads`) + `FREESCOUT_BOT_USER_ID` in Coolify; verify `threads` NOT NULL columns + note-type constants against the live FreeScout DB before enabling (the INSERT column set is marked unverified-against-live-schema in code). Until set, `ticket-respond` is registered but dormant — fail-safe (ticket stays `triaged`).
- → **Security Lead:** review the `freescout_user` write-credential scope + cross-app write posture (ADR-0003 §Review).
- **Activation wiring deferred:** `triageTicket` must emit `ops-hub/ticket.respond` on success — one-line `step.sendEvent`, NOT added (T-23 must not modify `ticket-triage.ts`; T-22 blocked on FQ-39). Add when T-22 validates, or add a `sweepTriagedTickets` cron mirroring `sweepNewTickets`.

**Handoff → QA Manager (T-24):** PR open, CI target green. The QA contract stub (`it.todo` list) in `ticket-respond.test.ts` is now converted to real assertions per its own instructions. Extend `ticket-state-machine.test.ts` to cover `triaged → responded`; the respond path's FreeScout delivery is mocked, so integration coverage of the state machine does not need the credential.

**✅ T-21 DONE (2026-06-23).** `pollFreeScout` cron verified end-to-end: two tickets confirmed in Supabase (`freescout_conversation_id: 6 + 7`), dedup working. FQ-31/33/34 resolved. PR #140 merged.

**⏳ T-22 IN PROGRESS (2026-06-23) — branch `feat/t22-ticket-triage`.**
`src/inngest/ticket-triage.ts`: two functions — `triageTicket` (event-driven on `ops-hub/ticket.triage`) and `sweepNewTickets` (cron `*/5 * * * *` to catch tickets predating T-22 deploy). Both registered in `src/index.ts`. 11 unit tests green. CI (lint, typecheck, test) all green locally. FQ-35 filed for LITELLM_URL + LITELLM_MASTER_KEY in Coolify — env-to-end triage is blocked until founder adds these.

**🟢 T-11 RUNBOOK READY (2026-06-20) — founder-run path chosen; agents never hold service_role key.**
Decision: rather than provide agents a `DATABASE_URL`, the founder applies the two migrations themselves using a copy-paste runbook → `docs/engineering/t11-migration-runbook.md`. Runbook gates migration 2 (`20260618120100_enable_rls_policies.sql`) behind Security Lead sign-off, uses per-file `psql -f` (NOT `supabase db push`, which would apply both migrations at once and bypass the gate), and includes PowerShell-native commands for the founder's Windows environment. **Security Lead sign-off recorded (2026-06-21, APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS, C1 applied — `authenticated` removed from `audit_log_insert`).** **Awaiting: founder execution — see FQ-15 in FOUNDER_QUEUE.md.** `ops_hub_app` login-role wiring follows in T-12.

**Branch protection (2026-06-20): ✅ FULLY ACTIVE.** GitHub Team upgrade executed. Branch protection configured on `main`: require Lint & Type Check + Unit Tests + Security Scan (all 3 required); strict (branches up to date); ≥1 approval; dismiss stale reviews; no direct push; no force-push; no deletion.

**Track A complete (2026-06-18), ahead of the Jun 27 due date.** All four artifacts authored and committed on branch `feature/sprint1-track-a-architecture`:
- T-01 → `docs/adr/0001-environment-topology.md` (incl. VPS sizing review; 70% util → founder resize escalation). Status Proposed — needs Prod Mgr deployability sign-off.
- T-02 → `docs/adr/0002-tool-stack.md` (7 tools, per-tool fallback triggers).
- T-03 → `docs/engineering/database-schema.md` + `supabase/migrations/20260618120000_initial_schema.sql` + `20260618120100_enable_rls_policies.sql`. **RLS is fail-closed; enforcement model split between `ops_hub_app` role (agent paths, GUC) and JWT (portal); `service_role` reserved for migrations/platform.** → **Security Lead: please review §6 flags in the schema doc — the service_role bypass model is the headline item; T-18 must test isolation via the agent (`ops_hub_app`) path, not just Auth.**
- T-05 → `docs/engineering/ci-cd-pipeline.md` rewritten implementation-ready. Toolchain decision: Node 20 + TS (pnpm) primary, Python 3.12 secondary. → **T-15 (GitHub Actions) can proceed against this spec without coming back to me.**

**Reconciliations made (flagged for owners, non-blocking M1):** `feature-flags.md` schema + helper use `project` text → must move to `project_id` uuid FK (now that `projects` table exists); `database-migrations.md` should note flat platform-migration layout vs. the future per-project subdirs.

**🟢 T-15 COMPLETE (2026-06-20) — PR #2 merged (0860ff4).**
Full Node 20 + TS + pnpm scaffold on `main`: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`, `vitest.config.ts`, `src/index.ts` (GET /health), `src/health.test.ts`, `Dockerfile` (multi-stage, non-root), `.githooks/pre-push`. All 3 CI checks green. Branch protection fully configured.

**T-07 (Inngest), T-13 (Sentry SDK init), and Coolify app staging deploy are now unblocked.**

**Handing off to Production Manager: begin T-08 (LiteLLM deployment to Coolify staging).** Specs ready in Production Manager section below.

No FOUNDER_QUEUE items raised for arch decisions — none are founder-owned per RACI. See FQ-05 (new) for LangFuse data residency note. The VPS-resize spend decision is correctly deferred behind the 70% monitoring trigger (ADR-0001 §6).

### QA Manager
**Active.** T-06 (test plan) done. **T-19 in progress (2026-06-21):** first integration test `src/integration/ticket-state-machine.test.ts` written — project→tenant→ticket(`new`)→assert→update(`triaged`)→assert→teardown (reverse-FK). Vitest + `@supabase/supabase-js`. Self-skips when `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` absent so CI stays green without secrets. Connects via `service_role` (RLS bypass) as a stopgap — **must migrate to `ops_hub_app_login` once T-12 (Vault + login role) lands** (`// TODO T-12` in file). Reconciled the stale CI wiring: `pr-checks.yml` integration guard + `package.json test:integration` repointed `tests/integration` → `src/integration` (matches the spec'd test path). PR opened. Local `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`test`/`test:integration` all green; `--frozen-lockfile` verified after adding supabase-js.

### Production Manager
**🟢 ACTIVE (2026-06-26)**

**triage-model alias configuration — BLOCKED ON FQ-40 (updated 2026-06-26, run #28210675694 — third 401).**

Run #28210675694 was triggered after the user confirmed NVIDIA_API_KEY was "corrected" in Coolify
and litellm-staging was fully redeployed. The 401 persists for the third time. OpenAI probe
confirmed passing (HTTP 200) for the second time — OPENAI_API_KEY is live and valid.

Confirmed from run #28210675694:
- litellm-staging health: HTTP 200
- Both NVIDIA_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY key names present in Coolify env config: confirmed
- Container redeployed (env injection working): confirmed — OPENAI probe HTTP 200
- OPENAI_API_KEY valid and injected: confirmed — gpt-4o-mini response HTTP 200
- NVIDIA model registrations succeeded: HTTP 200 on POST /model/new for both aliases
- NVIDIA smoke test (triage-model): HTTP 401 "Authentication failed" from NVIDIA NIM
- OpenAI fallback NOT registered (gate: NVIDIA smoke must pass — still not met)

The "corrected" key value is still being rejected by NVIDIA NIM. The key value itself is incorrect
or no longer valid at NVIDIA's side. FQ-40 updated. Two consecutive corrected-key deploys both fail
— escalating urgency.

Workflow committed for when NVIDIA resolves: `.github/workflows/register-litellm-openai-fallback.yml`

Next actions:
1. Founder: at https://build.nvidia.com — generate a fresh API key, copy the full value
   character-for-character, update NVIDIA_API_KEY in Coolify → litellm-staging → Deploy (not restart)
   Notify: "NVIDIA key regenerated and litellm-staging redeployed" → FQ-40
2. Production Manager (on FQ-40 resolved): `gh workflow run configure-litellm-triage-model.yml --repo admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00`
3. On NVIDIA pass: `gh workflow run register-litellm-openai-fallback.yml --repo admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00`
4. Verify both NVIDIA and OpenAI final tests pass in run log
5. Tech Lead (after both green): update `src/inngest/ticket-triage.ts` lines 71+173

PRs merged (all on main):
- PR #159: initial configure-litellm-triage-model.yml workflow
- PR #160: NVIDIA `nvidia_nim/` prefix → `openai/` + NVIDIA api_base fix
- PR #161: OpenAI `os.environ/` prefix fix attempt (openai/ + api_base)
- PR #162: NVIDIA-only aliases + OpenAI probe diagnostic (current main)
- FQ-40 (open): NVIDIA_API_KEY value rejected by NVIDIA NIM — three 401s across three runs

**LiteLLM model re-registration — ✅ DONE (2026-06-25).** triageTicket was returning LiteLLM 400 "Invalid model name passed in model=meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct". Root cause: STORE_MODEL_IN_DB registration wiped by full litellm-staging redeploys during T-22 network fixes (PRs #143–#145). Fix: PR #155 merged (5668ab73), `fix-litellm-model-registration.yml` run #28201769554 — all 9 steps green in 13s. POST /chat/completions HTTP 200, model response: "OK". Registration confirmed: model_id=48ea73ba-7c3c-4a88-a261-921558c3fc19, NVIDIA_API_KEY present on litellm-staging. LITELLM_DEFAULT_MODEL not set in ops-hub-app (triageTicket specifies model name explicitly). 24h monitoring window started. Rollback: POST /model/delete id=48ea73ba-7c3c-4a88-a261-921558c3fc19 (< 5 min).

**T-08: LiteLLM — ✅ DONE (2026-06-23).** `litellm-staging` live at `https://litellm-staging.inatechshell.ca`. NVIDIA NIM model `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` registered in LiteLLM DB (run #28043673055: POST /model/new HTTP 200, verified in /model/info: 1 entry). Root cause of 7+ hr 502: Traefik `loadbalancer.server.port=80` while LiteLLM listens on 4000. Fix: decoded base64 custom_labels, sed-replaced port refs, re-encoded, PATCHed + stop/start container recreation (PRs #119–#125). M1 criterion #4 complete. FQ-27 resolved.

**T-10: FreeScout — ✅ DONE (2026-06-23).** `https://freescout-staging.inatechshell.ca` live. Admin: `support@inatechshell.ca`. DB connected (Supabase Supavisor `freescout_user.yocoljutbiizdbfraapx`), migrations ran, admin user created. FQ-24 resolved: founder set FQDN in Coolify UI — Caddy now routes the custom domain correctly.

**ADR-0001 sign-off — now eligible.** T-08 + T-10 both live. Will sign off when ADR-0001 §6 is reviewed against current VPS utilisation.

**Sprint 2 pre-sprint ops — in progress (2026-06-23):**

**PT-1: FreeScout Webhooks module — ❌ ABANDONED. Pivoting to FreeScout API polling (2026-06-23).**
Root cause: the free GitHub module (`freescout-help-desk/freescout-webhooks`) did not activate in the `nfrastack/freescout` container. Module files are absent from `/www/html/Modules/` and "Webhooks" does not appear in the FreeScout sidebar. Most likely cause: the nfrastack image uses s6-overlay v3 (`/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/` init path), so our `COPY init-modules.sh /etc/cont-init.d/50-freescout-modules` script was silently ignored — it never ran. Verification requires `docker exec` into the Coolify VPS (no agent SSH access). Paid module ($19.99) is out of scope.
**Decision (agent-owned):** Pivot to FreeScout API polling. The FreeScout REST API is built-in with no module required. An Inngest cron function polling `GET /api/conversations` every 60 s gives equivalent intake with zero infrastructure dependency, is fully testable in CI, and removes the custom Docker image as an ongoing concern. T-21 is redefined accordingly. The custom image and `build-freescout-custom-image.yml` workflow are superseded — no further action needed on them.

**PT-2: FreeScout API + Api module — ❌ ABANDONED (2026-06-23).**
Root cause: FreeScout `Api` module disabled by default → `GET /api/conversations` returns HTTP 404. Enabling requires `artisan module:enable Api` inside the running container. No automated path: Coolify exec endpoint returns 404 (run #28072003626); no agent SSH access. Paid module: $19.99 out of scope.
Decision: pivot to Supabase direct polling. FreeScout's DB is already the same Supabase instance (`freescout_user.yocoljutbiizdbfraapx`; VPS outbound TCP:5432 open). T-21 polls FreeScout's `conversations` table directly. No API key needed. `FREESCOUT_API_KEY` cleanup queued in FQ-30 (non-blocking — founder removes from Coolify ops-hub-app env vars at next convenience). Custom FreeScout Docker image reverted to `nfrastack/freescout:latest` via `revert-freescout-image.yml`.

---

**T-07: Inngest — ✅ DONE (2026-06-22)**

ops-hub-app running at `https://ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca`. DNS A record: `ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca → 187.124.76.235`. Inngest Cloud synced at `https://ops-hub-staging.inatechshell.ca/api/inngest`. ops-hub registered in Inngest Production environment. FQ-18 resolved. Old sslip.io URL deprecated.

**Deploy regression fixed (2026-06-22, PR #85):** Deploy #35 (run #27981882684) failed — PATCH 422 `fqdn not allowed`. Root cause: PR #82 added `fqdn` to PATCH body; Coolify API always rejects it for docker image apps. Fix: removed `fqdn` from PATCH body. PATCH now sends only `docker_registry_image_name` + `docker_registry_image_tag` (both accepted). CI green on PR #85 — ready to merge and redeploy.

**T-09: LangFuse Cloud — ✅ DONE (2026-06-22).** `health-check` trace verified in LangFuse Cloud US. EU endpoint bug fixed (PR #86).

**T-13: Sentry — ✅ DONE (2026-06-22).** "Sentry test error from ops-hub-staging" visible in Sentry Issues tab. `SENTRY_DSN` confirmed in Coolify. `/debug-sentry` endpoint (PR #89) uses `Sentry.captureException()` — server stays up.

**T-14: UptimeRobot — ✅ DONE (2026-06-23, FQ-17 RESOLVED).** 3 monitors active: ops-hub-staging health, litellm-staging health, TTS app health. Free plan blocks API. `/api/inngest` monitor deleted — Inngest returns 405 on GET by design, causing false alerts. M1 #9 complete.

Remaining deploy order:
1. **T-07: Inngest** — ops-hub app creation + Inngest SDK init (next)
2. **T-11: Supabase migrations** — awaiting Security Lead sign-off + founder execution of runbook
3. **T-12: Vault setup** — after T-11; Security Lead coordinates
4. **T-14: UptimeRobot** — can start immediately for LiteLLM + FreeScout URLs
5. **T-13: Sentry** — SDK init in app code (with T-07)

### Security Lead
**✅ T-18 DONE (2026-06-22, PR #72) — cross-tenant RLS isolation test written.** Both T-12 and T-18 complete.

**T-18 — `src/integration/rls-isolation.test.ts`.** Rejected the task's literal spec: supabase-js + service_role + `rpc('set_config')` tests NOTHING (service_role bypasses RLS → returns all rows; and rpc/select are separate transactions so a transaction-local GUC evaporates). It would FAIL on real Supabase while sitting GREEN-SKIPPED in CI — a false "isolation verified" signal, the worst outcome for a security gate. Replaced with the Tech-Lead-ratified path (Option A): assertions run via the `pg` driver AS `ops_hub_app_login` (T-12's nobypassrls login role) so RLS genuinely engages — the runbook §8 "Real login-path RLS check." Three assertions (positive control + isolation + fail-closed); per-probe transaction with transaction-local GUC (pooler-safe). service_role used for setup/teardown only. Skips in CI without staging creds. See DECISIONS.md 2026-06-22.

**Run against staging before relying on it:** `pnpm test:integration` with `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `OPS_HUB_APP_LOGIN_URL` set against ops-hub-staging. CI auto-skips (no creds). Wiring CI staging creds for automated runs is an M2 follow-up. T-18 PR merges-after T-19 (PR #70).

**T-12 — done (PR #69 merged).** `ops_hub_app_login` login role + hardened `internal.get_secret()` accessor (V1–V5 conditions). Founder executes the secret migration per the runbook.

### Evals Lead
**🟡 T-17 IN PROGRESS (2026-06-22) — eval gate CI wiring authored.**

`Eval Gate` job added to `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`. Sprint 1 design = **structure-only validation, no live LLM calls**: the job loops over `evals/*.yaml` and runs `promptfoo validate -c <file>`, which checks each config against the promptfoo schema and exits non-zero on a malformed file (so a broken eval blocks merge). `promptfoo validate` is *intended* to be schema-only — no `anthropic:` provider or `llm-rubric` grader invocation, hence no API key — but **this has NOT been confirmed against these specific configs** (I could not run promptfoo in this sandbox). The first CI run on the PR is the verifier (see handoff step 4). If `validate` turns out to need a key, fall back to a plain YAML/JSON-schema lint of the eval files. promptfoo is run via `npx promptfoo@0.121` (NOT a project devDependency) deliberately, to keep the eval toolchain out of the app dependency closure so the other jobs' `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` is unaffected. `PROMPTFOO_DISABLE_TELEMETRY: 1` set; no `|| true` / `continue-on-error` (exit semantics honest). package.json gains `eval` (full keyed run, for later) + `eval:validate` (the structure-only loop) scripts — scripts only, lockfile untouched.

**To enable the real LLM-backed gate later:** add a provider key (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) as a repo secret, expose it to the `evals` job `env`, and swap the validate loop for `pnpm eval`. Trace-to-LangFuse (the original exit criterion) follows once a keyed run exists.

**Sandbox blockers (this environment denies shell / network / git-write / PR creation) — handoff required. The edits below are UNCOMMITTED in worktree `agent-aab6dec846179624a`; no branch was created.**
1. Create branch `feat/t17-eval-gate-ci` off `origin/main`, commit these edits (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`, `package.json`, `WORK.md`), push, open PR to `main` titled `T-17: Promptfoo eval gate wired into CI`.
2. **Before pushing, run `pnpm lint` (or `npx prettier --write package.json .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`).** The `lint` job runs `prettier --check .` over the WHOLE repo, so a non-canonical YAML/JSON edit would turn the sibling Lint check red on this very PR. I could not run prettier here.
3. *(Optional)* `pnpm add -D promptfoo --ignore-workspace` to add the devDependency + regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`. NOT required — CI uses `npx`, not the devDep. I intentionally did NOT hand-add the devDependency, because doing so without regenerating the lockfile desyncs `package.json` vs `pnpm-lock.yaml` and breaks `--frozen-lockfile` across ALL jobs (lint/test/security), a regression worse than the unfinished task. Add it only if local `pnpm eval` is wanted.
4. **Verify the gate is real, BEFORE adding it to branch protection — both halves or it isn't a gate:** (a) confirm the `Eval Gate` job is GREEN on the valid eval set with no API key in the environment; (b) push a deliberately broken eval YAML on a throwaway commit and confirm the job goes RED. A gate that's always green is a silent no-op.
5. After verification, add `Eval Gate` to `main` branch protection required checks (GET current protection on `admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00`, append `Eval Gate` to the existing 3: Lint & Type Check, Unit Tests, Security Scan — preserve all three). Tech Lead can own this per the T-17 fallback.

**Known nit:** the `eval:validate` package.json script uses bash `for ... do ... done` syntax — fine on CI/Linux and for the inline workflow loop (which does not use this script), but a Windows dev running `pnpm eval:validate` in cmd.exe will hit a parse error. Linux/CI-only; revisit if local Windows runs are needed.

T-16 (11 eval cases) ✅ done (PR #65).

### Knowledge Lead
**✅ T-20 DONE (2026-06-21) — KB structure committed.**

`docs/knowledge/kb-structure.md` — 6-category taxonomy, naming conventions, embedding model note (`text-embedding-ada-002`, 1536 dims), mandatory `WHERE project_id = $1` search pattern, RAG quality targets.

`supabase/migrations/20260621130000_kb_seed.sql` — seeds `ops-hub` project row (fixed UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, dev/staging only) + 2 placeholder KB articles (`Ops Hub — Getting Started`, `FreeScout → Ops Hub ticket intake runbook`). Embeddings null; ANN index deferred to Data Engineer embedding pipeline.

Notifying: QA Manager + Evals Lead — new KB domain content available for eval/test coverage. Data Engineer — 2 unembedded articles in `ops-hub` namespace ready for T-09 follow-up embedding pipeline.

### Frontend Engineer
**Minimal Sprint 1 scope.** No frontend tasks until FreeScout wired and ticket flow established (Sprint 2 / M2 scope). Monitor for T-10 completion — will be needed to verify FreeScout UI before sign-off.

### Data Engineer
**✅ T-09 DONE (2026-06-22).** `health-check` trace verified in LangFuse Cloud US dashboard.

`langfuse-node` v3 SDK wired (non-OTel — avoids double-provider conflict with Sentry OTel). `src/langfuse.ts`: null-guarded client, US endpoint default (`us.cloud.langfuse.com`), reads `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` → `LANGFUSE_HOST` → US default (PR #86 EU fix). `src/index.ts`: `void emitTrace("health-check")` on every `/health` request. `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` + `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` confirmed in Coolify staging env vars.

Monitor monthly event count against 50K free-tier ceiling (ADR-0002 §2 trigger at 70% = 35K events). Data residency: LangFuse Cloud US region approved for Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 (FQ-05). Revisit before M3.

**🟡 T-14 (2026-06-22) — UptimeRobot provisioning script authored (PR #73, pending merge).**
`scripts/provision-uptimerobot.sh` + `.github/workflows/provision-uptimerobot.yml` pushed and PR open. Monitors NOT yet created — dispatch requires PR #73 merged to main (workflow_dispatch not dispatchable from feature branches until the workflow exists on the default branch). Post-merge step: `gh workflow run provision-uptimerobot.yml --repo admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00`. Verify by confirming 3× `"stat":"ok"` in the run log. Three monitors: ops-hub-app (staging), LiteLLM (staging), FreeScout (staging); check interval: 5 min. Alert contacts intentionally empty — UptimeRobot requires a pre-created contact ID; email routing to mai@leelaecospa.com is a follow-up (create contact in UptimeRobot dashboard, update script or configure via UI). Prod monitors and TTS monitors deferred to post-M1.

### Solutions Architect
**T-04 ✅ Done (2026-06-21, PR #64).** Project Context schema committed.

**Sprint 2 — T-27: DNC project onboarding + ticket flow (M1 #12).** Assigned. Scope: instantiate DNC Project Context schema instance; configure routing rules in triage agent; verify a real DNC ticket flows from FreeScout → triage → respond → resolved. Depends on T-26 (pipeline validated). FQ-29 filed to confirm what "DNC" refers to (client project or ticket type) before T-27 scoping begins.
