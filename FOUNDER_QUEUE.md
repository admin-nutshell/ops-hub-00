# FOUNDER_QUEUE.md — Escalations to Founder

> Items needing founder input. Polled by founder 1–2x per day. All other decisions are agent-owned per RACI in `05_people_and_process.md`.

---

## Emergency stop

```
EMERGENCY_STOP: false
```

Setting `EMERGENCY_STOP: true` halts all agent activity immediately. Used only in genuine emergencies (security incident, runaway cost, suspected compromise). Restore to `false` after the situation is contained.

---

## Format

```
[Severity tag] [Agent name] Ask summary
        Context: <1–3 lines>
        Impact if delayed: <what happens if founder doesn't respond>
        Linked: <ticket / ADR / file references>
```

Severity tags:

| Tag | When to use | Founder response time |
|---|---|---|
| `URGENT:` | P1 incident, security signal, financial decision | < 1 hour |
| `BLOCKING:` | Agent cannot continue without answer | < 4 hours |
| *(none)* | Standard ask | < 24 hours |

Founder responds ONLY to business logic and UI/UX decisions.
All technical decisions (security, architecture, tooling, configuration) are made by the
relevant agent and presented as recommendations — not questions. Agents must bring a
recommendation WITH rationale, not a choice between options.

Founder response types:
- `APPROVED:` — business/UX decision accepted
- `REJECTED:` [reason] — business/UX decision declined
- `MORE INFO:` [specific business question] — only when business context is genuinely missing

After founder responds, the originating agent removes the item from this queue and proceeds. Resolved items archive to `docs/founder-queue-archive/YYYY-MM.md` weekly.

### FQ-09 — VPS firewall blocks outbound TCP:5432 — FreeScout cannot reach Supabase

```
MONITORING: [Production Manager] Root cause confirmed (2026-06-21). Agent-owned workaround
  in progress — founder action MAY NOT be needed.

  EVIDENCE (confirmed closed):
    - Port 5432 and port 6543 on aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com both DROP from VPS
      container (~35s timeout, runs #27890237911 + #27890511141). VPS firewall blocks ALL
      outbound PostgreSQL traffic to external hosts.

  AGENT WORKAROUND — PR #25 (2026-06-21, in CI):
    Switches FreeScout to a Coolify-managed internal PostgreSQL database (freescout-postgres).
    All DB traffic stays on the Docker internal network — VPS outbound firewall is irrelevant.
    If PR #25 deploy succeeds: FQ-09 is RESOLVED. No founder action needed.

  FOUNDER ACTION — only required if PR #25 deploy FAILS:
    Option A — Open outbound TCP:5432 via Coolify server settings (~2 min):
      1. Log into https://coolify.inatechshell.ca
      2. Servers → select VPS → Firewall (or Security)
      3. Add outbound rule: Protocol TCP, Port 5432, Direction Outbound, Action Allow
      4. Re-run deploy workflow (freescout-only)

    Option B — Open via SSH:
      sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT
      sudo iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT
      sudo netfilter-persistent save

  Impact if PR #25 also fails: founder must open port 5432 (see above).
  Linked: PR #25 (agent-owned fix), runs #27890237911 + #27890511141 (evidence)

### ~~FQ-08 — FreeScout MariaDB sidecar is crashing on Coolify VPS~~ — RESOLVED (agent-owned)

```
RESOLVED: [Production Manager] 2026-06-20 — no founder action required.

  Root cause identified: thatwebagency/freescout does NOT exist on Docker Hub (returns HTTP 404).
  The MariaDB sidecar crash was a secondary symptom; the primary failure was that Docker could
  never pull the FreeScout image on any deploy attempt.

  Fix applied via PR #17 (fix/freescout-postgresql-tiredofit):
    - Switched to tiredofit/freescout (actively maintained; latest release June 13, 2026;
      PostgreSQL support via DB_TYPE=pgsql)
    - Eliminated MariaDB sidecar; FreeScout now connects to existing Supabase PostgreSQL
    - FREESCOUT_STAGING_ADMIN_PASS secret created; SUPABASE_STAGING_DB_URL already present
    - Workflow: removes freescout-mariadb if present, deletes+recreates FreeScout app if
      still pointing to wrong image, sets tiredofit env vars with pgsql/Supabase config

  No cost impact: uses existing Supabase staging DB ($0 additional).
  Staging trade-off accepted: FreeScout tables co-tenant in Ops Hub Supabase public schema
  for Sprint 1 staging only; production will use a dedicated database.

  Linked: PR #18, DECISIONS.md 2026-06-20 [Production Manager] entry.

### ~~FQ-07 — Coolify API access feature gate is disabled~~ — RESOLVED (agent-confirmed)

```
RESOLVED: [Production Manager] 2026-06-21 — Coolify API access was enabled by founder
  (evidenced by all subsequent workflow runs returning HTTP 200 from /api/v1/servers).
  PRs #19–#22 all ran successfully against the Coolify API. No further action needed.
  FQ-07 archived to docs/founder-queue-archive/.
```

---

### ~~FQ-06 — Approve merge of PR #1: CI pipeline skeleton~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Merge PR #1. Agents handle all technical configuration
  including branch protection settings. Tech Lead owns branch protection setup —
  find a way to execute without repo admin or escalate to a solution.
```

---

### ~~FQ-01 — Coolify provisioning~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Coolify projects ops-hub-staging and ops-hub-prod provisioned
  at https://coolify.inatechshell.ca. Production Manager has full admin access via
  the existing Coolify instance. Proceed with T-07 through T-15.
```

---

### ~~FQ-02 — Supabase project for Ops Hub~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Supabase project for Ops Hub created (2026-06-18).
  Dedicated project (separate from TTS). pgvector enabled. Region: Canada Central
  (PIPEDA compliant). Connection details in docs/infrastructure/supabase-ops-hub.md
  (placeholder values — real values stored in Coolify env vars, never committed).
  T-11 (migrations) and T-12 (Vault setup) are now unblocked.
```

---

### ~~FQ-03 — Repo naming vs. charter~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Update docs to reflect actual repo name (admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00).
  Do not rename the repo. 09_delivery.md updated; DECISIONS.md logged.
```

---

### ~~FQ-05 — LangFuse Cloud data residency (PIPEDA awareness)~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — LangFuse US region approved for Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.
  Revisit before M3 when real tenant tickets start flowing.
```

---

### ~~FQ-04 — DNC go-live target date~~ — WITHDRAWN

```
WITHDRAWN: [Founder] — DNC is parked. Focus is building the Ops Hub system.
  M3 timeline is deferred until further notice. Solutions Architect proceeds
  with generic onboarding checklist only (no DNC-specific timeline).
```
