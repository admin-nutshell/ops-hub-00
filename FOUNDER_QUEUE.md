## FQ-40 — NVIDIA_API_KEY value rejected by NVIDIA NIM (401 Unauthorized)

**Filed:** 2026-06-26
**Updated:** 2026-06-26 (third run #28210675694 — user confirmed key "corrected" + redeployed; still 401)
**Filed by:** Production Manager
**Blocks:** T-22 (ticket-triage live validation), LiteLLM triage-model smoke test

### Current symptom (runs #28210294811 and #28210675694)

`configure-litellm-triage-model.yml` run #28210675694 failed at smoke test.
The user confirmed NVIDIA_API_KEY was "corrected" in Coolify and litellm-staging was fully redeployed
before this run. The 401 persists:
```
POST /chat/completions (model=triage-model) -> HTTP 401
litellm.AuthenticationError: OpenAIException - Error code: 401
{'status': 401, 'title': 'Unauthorized', 'detail': 'Authentication failed'}
Received Model Group=triage-model
Available Model Group Fallbacks=None
```

This is the third workflow run showing HTTP 401 from NVIDIA NIM (runs #28209902312,
#28210294811, #28210675694).

### What is confirmed working

- litellm-staging container is up and reachable (health check passed)
- Both `NVIDIA_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` key names are present in Coolify env config
- Container was fully redeployed (env injection confirmed)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid and injected: OpenAI probe (native gpt-4o-mini, no api_key field) → HTTP 200
- LiteLLM model registration for `triage-model` alias → HTTP 200 (registration itself succeeds)

### Root cause (updated)

The `NVIDIA_API_KEY` value stored in Coolify is being **rejected by the NVIDIA NIM API** with
HTTP 401. The previous hypothesis (restart vs redeploy) no longer applies — the full redeploy
confirmed that OPENAI_API_KEY is injected and working.

The NVIDIA_API_KEY is present in the running container (key name confirmed by Coolify API, and
the redeploy would have injected it), but when LiteLLM sends it to
`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` using `os.environ/NVIDIA_API_KEY`, NVIDIA returns 401.

Possible causes (founder to verify):
1. The key value was entered incorrectly in Coolify (truncated, extra whitespace, wrong copy)
2. The key is valid but not activated for `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` model access in NVIDIA NIM
3. The key belongs to a different NVIDIA service (e.g., NIM Microservices vs integrate.api.nvidia.com)
4. The key was revoked or expired at NVIDIA's side after being generated

### Required action (founder)

1. Go to https://build.nvidia.com → API Keys and verify the key value character-for-character
2. Confirm the key has access to the NIM catalog model `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` at
   `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`
3. If the key is wrong: update `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in Coolify UI → litellm-staging → Environment
   Variables, then click Deploy (full redeploy)
4. If the key is correct but still fails: generate a fresh key at https://build.nvidia.com,
   update Coolify, and redeploy
5. Notify Production Manager: "NVIDIA key updated and litellm-staging redeployed"

### What NOT to do

Do NOT click Restart after updating the key — only Deploy (full redeploy) injects updated env vars.

### Additional confirmed data point (run #28210675694)

The OpenAI probe in step 7 passed (HTTP 200) in both run #28210294811 and #28210675694.
This confirms `OPENAI_API_KEY` is live and valid in the running container. If NVIDIA cannot
be resolved, OpenAI can serve as the sole provider temporarily.

A ready-to-trigger workflow has been committed to unblock once NVIDIA is fixed:
`.github/workflows/register-litellm-openai-fallback.yml`

### After resolution

Production Manager action on receipt of notification:
1. Run: `gh workflow run configure-litellm-triage-model.yml --repo admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00`
2. Verify NVIDIA smoke test passes (HTTP 200)
3. On NVIDIA pass: `gh workflow run register-litellm-openai-fallback.yml --repo admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00`
4. Verify both NVIDIA and OpenAI final tests pass (HTTP 200 each)
5. Close FQ-40, update WORK.md T-22 status
