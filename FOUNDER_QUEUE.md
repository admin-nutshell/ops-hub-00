# FOUNDER_QUEUE.md — Escalations to Founder

> Items needing founder input. Polled by founder 1–2x per day. All other decisions are agent-owned per RACI in `05_people_and_process.md`.

---

## Emergency stop

```
EMERGENCY_STOP: false
```

Setting `EMERGENCY_STOP: true` halts all agent activity immediately. Used only in genuine emergencies (security incident, runaway cost, suspected compromise). Restore to `false` after the situation is contained.

---

## Format

```
[Severity tag] [Agent name] Ask summary
        Context: <1–3 lines>
        Impact if delayed: <what happens if founder doesn't respond>
        Linked: <ticket / ADR / file references>
```

Severity tags:

| Tag | When to use | Founder response time |
|---|---|---|
| `URGENT:` | P1 incident, security signal, financial decision | < 1 hour |
| `BLOCKING:` | Agent cannot continue without answer | < 4 hours |
| *(none)* | Standard ask | < 24 hours |

Founder responds ONLY to business logic and UI/UX decisions.
All technical decisions (security, architecture, tooling, configuration) are made by the
relevant agent and presented as recommendations — not questions. Agents must bring a
recommendation WITH rationale, not a choice between options.

Founder response types:
- `APPROVED:` — business/UX decision accepted
- `REJECTED:` [reason] — business/UX decision declined
- `MORE INFO:` [specific business question] — only when business context is genuinely missing

After founder responds, the originating agent removes the item from this queue and proceeds. Resolved items archive to `docs/founder-queue-archive/YYYY-MM.md` weekly.

### FQ-11 — T-10 FreeScout: Supabase Supavisor pooler rejects project — action needed in Supabase dashboard

```
BLOCKING: [Production Manager] CONFIRMED 2026-06-21 — both poolers fail. Run #27914003478.

  BOTH Supabase pooler endpoints return ENOTFOUND for project yocoljutbiizdbfraapx:
    Session pooler    aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432  → exit 2 (tenant not found)
    Transaction pooler aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543 → exit 2 (tenant not found)

  This is NOT a VPS/Docker or network issue — tested directly from GitHub Actions (Azure East US).
  TCP connects, TLS succeeds, Supavisor rejects at auth phase. Project is not registered
  with the Supavisor pooler at aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com.

  Likely causes (one of):
    1. Project region is NOT ca-central-1 → pooler hostname is wrong
    2. Connection Pooling was never enabled for this project → Supavisor never registered it
    3. Project is paused (free tier) → Supavisor removes paused tenants

  ACTION NEEDED (< 5 minutes in the Supabase dashboard):

  Please open https://supabase.com/dashboard → ops-hub project → Project Settings → Database.
  Look for the "Connection pooling" section and the "Poolers" section.

  Report back ONE of the following (no password needed):
    A) Copy the "Session mode" connection string HOST only from the dashboard
       (it will look like: aws-0-{region}.pooler.supabase.com)
       If it differs from aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com → that's the fix
    B) If the project shows "Paused" → click Resume Project, then reply "project was paused"
    C) If Connection Pooling section shows a toggle → confirm it is ON

  This is a single dashboard check. Once the correct hostname or status is confirmed,
  agents will update the workflow without further founder input.

  Impact if delayed: T-10 FreeScout undeployed; M1 #6 blocked.
  Linked: FQ-10 (resolved), runs #27913431979 (#39) + #27914003478 (#40), DECISIONS.md

### ~~FQ-10 — T-10 FreeScout: VPS directory permissions block PostgreSQL; architecture choice needed~~ — RESOLVED

```
RESOLVED: [Production Manager] 2026-06-21 — Founder chose Option B (Supabase).
  VPS outbound TCP:5432 is now OPEN (iptables rule added by founder).
  Workflow reverted to tiredofit/freescout + Supabase PostgreSQL (PRs #36–#37).
  Coolify-managed PostgreSQL permanently abandoned on this VPS (bind-mount root:root
  permission bug is systemic; all 10 autonomous fix paths were exhausted in PRs #25–#34).
  New active blocker: Supabase session pooler rejects project (see FQ-11).
  Linked: PRs #25–#37, FQ-09 (superseded), FQ-11 (active)
```

### ~~FQ-09 — VPS firewall blocks outbound TCP:5432~~ — SUPERSEDED BY FQ-10

```
SUPERSEDED: [Production Manager] 2026-06-21 — the PR #25 agent workaround (internal PG)
  ultimately failed due to VPS directory permission issues (see FQ-10). FQ-09's recommended
  action (open outbound TCP 5432) is now the RECOMMENDED path in FQ-10 Option B.
  This item is retained for reference. No separate founder action needed — FQ-10 covers it.
  Linked: FQ-10 (active), PRs #25–#34

### ~~FQ-08 — FreeScout MariaDB sidecar is crashing on Coolify VPS~~ — RESOLVED (agent-owned)

```
RESOLVED: [Production Manager] 2026-06-20 — no founder action required.

  Root cause identified: thatwebagency/freescout does NOT exist on Docker Hub (returns HTTP 404).
  The MariaDB sidecar crash was a secondary symptom; the primary failure was that Docker could
  never pull the FreeScout image on any deploy attempt.

  Fix applied via PR #17 (fix/freescout-postgresql-tiredofit):
    - Switched to tiredofit/freescout (actively maintained; latest release June 13, 2026;
      PostgreSQL support via DB_TYPE=pgsql)
    - Eliminated MariaDB sidecar; FreeScout now connects to existing Supabase PostgreSQL
    - FREESCOUT_STAGING_ADMIN_PASS secret created; SUPABASE_STAGING_DB_URL already present
    - Workflow: removes freescout-mariadb if present, deletes+recreates FreeScout app if
      still pointing to wrong image, sets tiredofit env vars with pgsql/Supabase config

  No cost impact: uses existing Supabase staging DB ($0 additional).
  Staging trade-off accepted: FreeScout tables co-tenant in Ops Hub Supabase public schema
  for Sprint 1 staging only; production will use a dedicated database.

  Linked: PR #18, DECISIONS.md 2026-06-20 [Production Manager] entry.

### ~~FQ-07 — Coolify API access feature gate is disabled~~ — RESOLVED (agent-confirmed)

```
RESOLVED: [Production Manager] 2026-06-21 — Coolify API access was enabled by founder
  (evidenced by all subsequent workflow runs returning HTTP 200 from /api/v1/servers).
  PRs #19–#22 all ran successfully against the Coolify API. No further action needed.
  FQ-07 archived to docs/founder-queue-archive/.
```

---

### ~~FQ-06 — Approve merge of PR #1: CI pipeline skeleton~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Merge PR #1. Agents handle all technical configuration
  including branch protection settings. Tech Lead owns branch protection setup —
  find a way to execute without repo admin or escalate to a solution.
```

---

### ~~FQ-01 — Coolify provisioning~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Coolify projects ops-hub-staging and ops-hub-prod provisioned
  at https://coolify.inatechshell.ca. Production Manager has full admin access via
  the existing Coolify instance. Proceed with T-07 through T-15.
```

---

### ~~FQ-02 — Supabase project for Ops Hub~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Supabase project for Ops Hub created (2026-06-18).
  Dedicated project (separate from TTS). pgvector enabled. Region: Canada Central
  (PIPEDA compliant). Connection details in docs/infrastructure/supabase-ops-hub.md
  (placeholder values — real values stored in Coolify env vars, never committed).
  T-11 (migrations) and T-12 (Vault setup) are now unblocked.
```

---

### ~~FQ-03 — Repo naming vs. charter~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — Update docs to reflect actual repo name (admin-nutshell/ops-hub-00).
  Do not rename the repo. 09_delivery.md updated; DECISIONS.md logged.
```

---

### ~~FQ-05 — LangFuse Cloud data residency (PIPEDA awareness)~~ — RESOLVED

```
APPROVED: [Founder] — LangFuse US region approved for Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.
  Revisit before M3 when real tenant tickets start flowing.
```

---

### ~~FQ-04 — DNC go-live target date~~ — WITHDRAWN

```
WITHDRAWN: [Founder] — DNC is parked. Focus is building the Ops Hub system.
  M3 timeline is deferred until further notice. Solutions Architect proceeds
  with generic onboarding checklist only (no DNC-specific timeline).
```
